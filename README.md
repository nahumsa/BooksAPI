# Books API using golang

This is an REST API that is constructed to read a database of books. This is based on the article from [Rahman Fadhil](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-build-a-rest-api-with-golang-using-gin-and-gorm/), where I addapted the implementation to use Postgres.

For the first time you run, use the `-reset` flag.

Todo:

- [x] Create database
- [x] Migrate database
- [x] Add a flag to reset the database
- [x] Add books to the database
- [ ] Delete books
- [x] Query all books
- [ ] Query selected author
- [ ] Query Book title
