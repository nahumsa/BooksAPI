# Books API using golang

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/a4e37324ec5fd722f252)

This is an REST API that is constructed to read a database of books. This is based on the article from [Rahman Fadhil](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-build-a-rest-api-with-golang-using-gin-and-gorm/), where I adapted the implementation to use PostgreSQL.

For the first time you run, use the `-reset` flag.



Todo:

- [x] Create database
- [x] Migrate database
- [x] Add a flag to reset the database
- [x] Add books to the database
- [ ] Delete books
- [x] Query all books
- [x] Query book id
- [ ] Query selected author
- [ ] Query Book title
