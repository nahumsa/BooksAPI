# Books API using golang

This is an REST API that is constructed to read a database of books. This is based on the article from [Rahman Fadhil](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-build-a-rest-api-with-golang-using-gin-and-gorm/), where I addapted the implementation to use Postgres.


Todo:
[X] Create database
[X] Migrate database
[ ] Add books to the database
[ ] Delete books
[ ] Query all books
[ ] Query selected author
[ ] Query Book title
